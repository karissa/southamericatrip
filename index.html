    <h1>Karissa and Eva's trip to South America</h1>
    <p>
      We packed our things and said goodbye to our bands. Eva had a recording
      with Banda Sin Nombre right before we left, it was a bittersweet ending after
      all their hard work producing their second album.
    </p>

    <p>
      Karissa's mom came into town and helped her record a music video for The Wyatt Act's new song
      called Everything's Fine.. (my mom rocks!!!)
    </p>
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/IMG_8184.JPG" />
    <p>
      Then we went on almost 24 hours worth of flights....
    </p>
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/first-part/resized-IMG_8230.JPG" />
    <h3>Buenos Aires, Argentina</h3>

    <p>Then we landed in Buenos Aires for one week! I went to give a presentation
      about the work I'd been doing for the past few years to 500 Argentinian men
      in their early twenties.
    </p>
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/first-part/resized-IMG_8286.JPG" style="transform: rotate(180deg)"/>

    <p>
      The highlights included seeing the most
    amazing music and bands in underground venues, eating delicious carne
    parrilla style, and taking a tango class.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bands we saw were amazing,
      one being a cumbia/salsa/ska mix band with all their own music, which was also
      harmonies, brass section, and an old man with one arm who made
      speeches of social justice over the music. The man in the video who is on the projector
      is named Santiago Maldonado, an activist who died.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also saw a Northern Argentinian Andino Folkloric band that
      took electronic music to a whole other level... it was more true to folklore than to electronic music, guided by the
      musicians professor who taught what they could and couldn't do to respect the
      tradition and yet still get creative with it.
    </p>

    <p>
    In Buenos Aires, we hung out with our friend Amanda most of the time and met some of her friends, went to a fun
    techno party and drank a lot of cheap and good local wine and Argentinian pizza. We stayed in
    Palermo, but that doesn't mean much because it seems like everthing is in Palermo.
    We did accomplish leaving Palermo, though! We found a rave and a pizza
    place and a cemetary, also our friend's house. Pretty cool. All in all, Buenos aires is a vibrant city, with a buzzing
    energy like New York. They have free education including college, for
    anyone, and tons of free workshops and classes all over town in anything
    you can think of. It was definitely hard to leave this place.</p>

    <h3>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</h3>

    <p>Then, we went to Rio de Janeiro for one week. Amanda came
    too! And our friend Andrew who also plays trumpet. It was very beautiful but also really huge and we only had time to scratch the surface of this
    city. We played music with a band from Austin, Texas called Minor Mishap.
    They are a brass band, sort of like Brass Liberation Orchestra but without
    the focus on politics. We played in the HONK 2017 festival, and a fun
    moment was the procession of Tubas that ran down a street with
    over 500 people chasing after them (sorry no pics). One of our favorite bands
    was from Costa Rica, and we have a video of them when they played on the beach on
    the last day of the festival.

    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/first-part/resized-IMG_8386.JPG" />

    <p>
      It was hard for me because I didn't
      know Brazillian Portugese and my mission is to learn Spanish right now, but Eva was
      able to get by with her Portugese, even though it was barely working
      because the accent in Brazil is so different than the one in Northern
      Portugal!! But thankfully we had Andrew to help us navigate!
    </p>
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/first-part/resized-IMG_8501.JPG" />
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/first-part/resized-IMG_8483.JPG"  />
    <p>The beaches in Rio de Janeiro are amazing. We went to two different ones and had an amazing time
    in the water, and the mountains near the water are dramatic, dinosaur-era
    seeming and make you feel like you're on the edge of a majestic city. We visited an amazing art project called
    Projeto Morinnho which is in a favela near Santa Teresa.
  </p>
  <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/first-part/resized-IMG_8530.JPG" />
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/first-part/resized-IMG_8422.JPG" />
    <p>
      Everyone we met
    was really nice and we ate a lot of interesting local food and drink, too.
    Andrew showed us the best spot to drink cachaça, which is a really
    interesting  (and alcoholic) local drink that comes in tons of flavors, so
    you can pretend you're drinking different types of candy. </p>
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/first-part/resized-IMG_8416.JPG" />
    <p>All in all, Rio
    de Janeiro is a breathtakingly intense place, and the poverty reminded us a lot of the
    larger cities in the USA. </p>

    <h3>Santiago, Chile</h3>
    <p>
      Next, we went to Santiago, Chile and hung out with Eva's family. Lots of dominoes,
      food, local politics and shabat! We went to the synagogue that Eva's cousin
      helped start which is very focused on music. Eva got to catch up with all of the kids
      who are no longer kids :)
    </p>
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/resized-santiago4.jpg" />
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/resized-santiago5.jpg" />
      <p>
      We saw the most amazing drag performance at a party Eva's friend Andrew brought
      us to. Andrew is an expert in underground queer events. The drag queen
      danced to metal while smashing lightbulbs over her head.
      It was really different than the performances we're used
      to in the Bay.
    </p>

    <h3>Valparaiso, Chile</h3>
    <p>
      Then we went to Valparaiso for two weeks. The town is covered in murals
      and fleas. But really, there are dogs *everywhere* in the streets. It has beautiful
      views and colors, and being a college town, has lots of young people and art!
    </p>

    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/resized-valpo11.jpg" />
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/20171127_161329.jpg" />
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/resized-valpo15.jpg"  />
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/resized-mural2.jpg" />
    <p> We bounced around three places to live. First, what was basically a
      squat, the dirty kind, but with airbnb prices...
      We left the squat pretty quickly because we will only
      do fleas if its rent free....ouch!

      We found out about some really powerful community building activity in the neighborhood,
      and we painted a couple murals! </p>
      <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/resized-IMG_8811.JPG" />
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/resized-valpo12.jpg" style="transform: rotate(180deg)"/>
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/resized-20171130_171811.jpg" />
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/20171129_192510.jpg" />

      <p> Then we went to a very nice hostel...
      except there people who didn't go do anything except lounge... so we
      didn't hang out with many of them.
      Then finally, we found our dreamy place through a friend of friends,
       with incredible views,
      a guitar, and the craziest coolest cat.
    </p>
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/resized-20171130_161817.jpg"  />
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/resized-20171128_130733.jpeg" />
    <p>
      We listened to lots of cueca chora, which is a type of music that comes
      from that part of Chile. It was really powerful music, and that combined
      with the local alcohol - 'chica' - really makes you experience the night
      in a profound way. Karissa learned how to play the pandero using a wet thumb
      from one of the musicians.
    </p>

    <video controls="controls" width="560" src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/20171117_021700.mp4"></video>
    <p>
      We also enjoyed the Valpo nightlife with our friends...
    </p>
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/20171126_035054.jpg" />
    <p>
      And Eva took a three-week clown class at the ex-carcel, an old prison built during the dictatorship that is
      now used as a cultural center.
    </p>
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/resized-20171130_194821.jpg" />
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/resized-IMG_8670.JPG"  />
    <p>
      They have tons of different classes,
      a soccer field, and an art gallery that is used for events. When Karissa went
      there once, she met some musicians and they asked her to record on their
      album. At first she didn't think they meant 'record' cause she's still
      learning Spanish and there is so much slang in Chile, 'grabacion' could
      really mean anything, but really they meant 'record' so it happened.. it was
      a badass working class feminist with two others, sort of soul/funk
      inspired music with rap on top. Very nice. Karissa also played salsa with a band at our favorite bar, El Canario.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karissa also recorded on another two songs with a guy named Jimy, he is awesome and
      invited us back to play music with him and stay at his house. We will
      probably stay there next time we are in Valparaiso.
    </p>

    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/resized-IMG_8854.JPG"  style="transform: rotate(180deg)" />
    <p>
      And then we went to el campo, where we spent time with Eva's family,
      relaxing in a very beautiful house full of family photos and weird
      collections of her Tia Rosita. It was our last bit of down time before
      a lot of non stop travel.

    <h3>Guayaquil, Ecuador</h3>
    <p>
      Guayaquil omg not our favorite. But the kids were cute! Our host
      was the director of a local non profit education center partnered with an
      organization that works to erradicate child labr. We went to an event where
       the kids performed...it was incredible! And we had the opportunity to
       facilitate a drumming workshop with 5 classes of kids!
     </p>

     <p>

      The only other parts
        about Guayaquil we liked were the  iguanas we could hang out with in the
        central plaza and a really big section of town filled with
        Karaoke bars... but we decided to leave Guayaquil early in favor of going to
        Montañita, which is basically like the new orleans of beach towns in Ecuador.
        We went to a party for one night, with mango coladas and mosquitos.
      Karissa's face swelled up after our first night on the coast and we confirmed
      mosquito nets are useful...
    </p>

    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/ecuador-blog/resized-20171207_173152.jpg" />
    <h3>Puerto Lopez, Ecuador</h3>
    <p>From Montañita we went to Puerto Lopez, a really cute fisherman town
      where we ate fresh fish and shrimp for very cheap at the market right on the
      beach by our hostel, which was a treehouse! From Puerto Lopez we took different
      excursions around the area... an island nearby full of blue footed birds
      that had just hatched their eggs, sea turtles and colorful fish...
    </p>

    <p>
      We then had a great ecotourism exprience where a local guide from the indigenous community showed us,
      on horseback, the humid forest where his community lives and preserves the land.
      He pointed out medicinal plants, wild monkeys, and birds. We finished the day with a home cooked meal with
      his family. It's called ruta de san salvador, near puerto lopez. They need help calling out and stopping
      the deforestation that's happening for cattle feeding land in the legally protected area. He said
      the local authorities ignored the community's complaints.
    </p>

    <h3>Quito, Ecuador</h3>
    <p>
      Then, the next highlight of our trip -- QUITO! After a long 8 hour
      overnight bus ride we finally made it to the CAPITAL of Ecuador. We
      stayed with friends of friends, Mariela and Maya, who are so nice and
      helped us get around town. The elevation was difficult to deal with -- we
      saw music and art all weekend but ended up getting tired quickly each
      night. I played some trumpet in a cafe with Mariela's two-piece band, which is
      mostly old-school jazz and swing.     </p>
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/chile-blog/IMG_20171216_200559.jpg" />

    <p>
      We also saw two amazing performances, one live electronic music production by a friend of a friend
      who used to live in Oakland. We also saw a band called Los NIN (not nine inch nails) from Otovalo, Ecuador
      that includes Quechua and indigenous rhythms.
    </p>

    <p>
      We made friends with Mariela's bandmate, and ended up spending a couple days with his adorable family and dogs
      in Tumbaco, a rural little town not far from Quito. Karissa and Eva have also been drawing a lot!
    </p>
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/ecuador-blog/resized-20171217_171005.jpg" />
    <img src="https://incaseofbadthings.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/resize/ecuador-blog/resized-20171217_170944.jpg" />
    <h3>Lago Agrio/Amisacho, Ecuador</h3>
    <p> Through Karissa's work we were at an incredible celebration which reunited 150
      people of several indigenous nationalities of the Amazon that are united against
      the threats to their communities by oil drilling, deforestation and governments
      not recognizing protected territories, in an organization called Alianza CEIBO.
      It was incredible! Lots of soccer, plantain
      chicha , feasting, dancing and being immersed in other cultures. Many of the people
      we met live in territories deep in the jungle and that are preserved though threatened.
      Many tribes are just a few families left keeping a language and culture alive
      and partnering with international environmental organizations to preserve the rainforest.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, just like that, everyone was gone for the holidays. We stayed a whole
      week at the beautiful headquarters... an oasis of reforested land, where the same bird
      said hello to us at our window everymoring heavily pecking, and we heard the monkeys
      screaming at sun rise! Just the relaxation we needed. We cooked for the owners
      and learned how to make maito, amazonian fish over the coals.
    </p>

    <p>
      (You can't take the city girl out of either of us so a couple karaoke nights
